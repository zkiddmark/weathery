A really simple weather app.

## Getting Started

This is my first Flutter project ever, it is a simple weather app.
The data is provided from https://openweathermap.org.

To get it up and running, simply clone the repo and the run it in either a andriod phone/emulator or iOS phone/emulator.
I've tried it in an iPhone 12 and in some different emulators.

I wrote this app mainly to get some familiarity with Flutter and Dart, it still needs some polishing but it's been a fun project and nice to have in the portfolio.
